# Gatherer-TBC-FarmHud-Compatible

Forked from [Gatherer v3.1.2](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gatherer/files/82338).

Old Gatherer's API did not allow to change the Minimap frame associated with Gatherer Notes, which is now added.

This version is compatible with [FarmHud-TBC](https://github.com/XiconQoo/FarmHud-TBC).

## Changes

- added `Gatherer.MiniNotes.SetCurrentMinimap(frame)` (change on which frame to show herb/ore/etc Gatherer Notes)
